### Features Added
I've started to look for work after taking some time off to teach myself web development. As a part of getting back to work, I took a moment to brush off my old personal site and redo my resume. Instead of using Adobe in Design, I built this resume on an existing Bootstrap template I purchased.   

The design was simple and allowed me to make a few minor modifications to hold the content of my work experience and skills.    

However, there was no easy way to export a .pdf version of the resume. After a small amount of research, I found my answer on StackOverflow with a JQuery solution that I rewrote in vanilla JS. I added an export button at the bottom that's only visible on the desktop, and now it can be easily downloaded by myself or possible employers.
